This README explains how to get, install and adjust the guilt - the bash
utility to work with patches on the git branches.

Install git-guilt
-----------------

  $ git clone git://repo.or.cz/guilt.git guilt-src
or
  $ git clone https://github.com/ansv/guilt.git guilt-src

then
  $ cd guilt-src && make install


Install documentation (optional)
--------------------------------

  $ make install-doc


Deploy guilt-path extention
---------------------------

This shows the path of the current gult path and is used by many scripts below.

  $ ln -s $(pwd)/guilt-path $(dirname $(which guilt))/../lib/guilt/


Useful shortcuts
----------------

In .bashrc/.zshrc:

  alias q='guilt'
  alias qn='guilt next'
  alias qp='guilt path'


Extend the search path for guilt extentions
-------------------------------------------

In .bashrc/.zshrc:

  PATH="/home/ac/utils/guilt-ext:$PATH"

This enables the quick acess to the utilities qq, qmap, qcat, qgc and xplant.


Add autocompletion
------------------

In .bashrc/.zshrc:

  source ~/utils/guilt-ext/qcat-completion.bash  # for 'qcat'
  source ~/utils/guilt-ext/guilt-completion.bash  # for 'guilt' and 'q'


Hints
-----

  $ qq  # shows the current status of the patch-queue:
	# This shows the unapplied patches, then changed files (that are not in
	# the patches) if any, then the applied patches as an oneline git log
	# and finally the base for the patch queue.

  $ qn  # (guilt next) shows the name of the next unapplied patch

  $ q fold `qn`  # fold next patch to the current one (see guilt fold)

  $ qcat <patchname>  # prints the <patch> on the standard output

  $ qcat `qn`  # prints the next unapplied patch on the standard output

  $ qcat `qn` |xd  # brings the next unapplied patch to the vimdiff

  $ qmap  # shows all files touched by each applied patch from the patch queue.

  $ qmap -p  # the same as above but shows the names with the full path

  $ qgc  # (guillt garbage collector) cleanups patch directory:
	 # This deletes all automatically backed up files (that have ~ at the
	 # end of the file name) and shows unused pathes.

  $ qgc --all  # deletes all unused patches from the patch directory
