This HOWTO explains how to get, install and adjust the guilt - the bash utility
to work with patches on the git branches.

Mandatory things
================

Get the sources
---------------

  $ git clone https://github.com/ansv/guilt.git guilt

This is the extended version of the original git://repo.or.cz/guilt.git


Install
-------

  $ make install


Optional things
===============

Install documentation if needed
-------------------------------

  $ make install-doc


Be faster, know where you are
=============================


Use short alias instead of guilt
--------------------------------

Add into your .bashrc/.zshrc and use 'q' instead of 'guilt':

  alias q=guilt


Add autocompletion
------------------

Add the following line into your .bashrc/.zshrc and use autocompletion

  source ~/utils/guilt-completion.bash  # git-prompt.sh is in ~/utils/

This also works for 'q'.


Show patch-queue state
----------------------

After creating the symbolic link to the qq in path'ed directory like

  # ln -s ~/utils/qq /usr/local/bin/qq

you can quick show the status of the current guilt patch-queue:

  $ qq

This shows the unapplied patches, then changed files (that are not in the
patches) if any, then the applied patches as an oneline git log and finally the
base for the patch queue.


Next patch in the queue
-----------------------

After creating the symbolic link to the qnext in path'ed directory like

  # ln -s ~/utils/qnext /usr/local/bin/qn

you can use qn for quick access the next patch in the patch queue:

  $ q cat `qn`

This shows the content of the next patch.


Show changed files by the patch queue
-------------------------------------

After creating the symbolic link to the qmap in path'ed directory like

  # ln -s ~/utils/qmap /usr/local/bin/qmap

you can use

  $ qmap

to show all the files touched by each applied patch from the patch queue.
