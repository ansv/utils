# This script shows diff output as two windows in vimdiff.
#
# Usage:
#   git diff ... |xd
#   hg diff ... |xd
#   svn diff ... |xd
#   cat some.patch |xd
#
# You can also preprocess diff output to get more precise results:
#   $ git diff ... |grep -v ... |sed ... |xd
#   $ cat some.patch |grep -v ... |sed ... |xd

# substitution to and from ' #xd\#' cares about "!! No newline at end of file" message

# throw away "--- a/filename" and "+++ b/filename" to have less output
# the filenames are anyway there in "diff" line
